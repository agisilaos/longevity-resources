# longevity-resources
Repository containing scientifically rigorous information on techniques/treatments to increase the human life span &amp; combating threatening diseases / conditions. 

*Note: these are not necessarily approved for general population yet and can be at any stage of the research / market spectrum.*

Over the course of Spring 2019, I will be uploading research papers, articles, case studies, etc for various diseases that have come from recommendations and are just sitting in various inboxes / note apps / printed out and on my desk when **it should be aggregated, organized, and readily accessible to educate the public about more potentially life-saving options**. This should be obvious, but use this information at your own risk.

# call for action - please help 
Please submit a pull request if you have good resources to contribute. Thank you in advance :purple_heart:

In the pull request submission, if possible, please provide helpful information so that we can keep the content quality as high as possible:

1.  Which disease(s) / condition(s) does the content address?
2.  Why it is important for people to consider + elevate in importance?
3.  At what stage is it in currently along the research/market spectrum? What is the outlook for it?
4.  Any info (inline or external link) on how you came across it
For example, it could be useful to answer any of these that are relevant + useful:
- *Did you or someone you know have this treatment?*
- *Are you a researcher or practicioner in that specific area?*
- *Are you active in one of the communities that is involved in longevity?*

However, if adding this extra information will preclude you from submitting a PR, please submit it anyway. In that case, it would take much longer to decide to merge the PR, but I would be happy to take on the responsibility to seek out that information to have a guage on its credibility. 

If you had this treatment but would prefer to submit anonymously, please reach out to me via twitter.com/meghafon (DMs are open). I will work to set up a fully anonymized system in the future
